## Workflow:

If you would like to contribute to `pRecipe` you should create an issue with the
enhancement label and state your possible addition in order to check if it 
belongs in the package or if it is not something we are already working on. If 
we agree your suggestion should be part of `pRecipe` and no one is already 
working on it, fork the dev branch, work on your fork, and then create a 
pull request to merge it into dev.
